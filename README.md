## Hi there 👋
I’m Andrea!

I’m a graduate of the 8-month practical Data Analytics course from LSE, with hands-on experience in various data tools for cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to drive decision-making and change. 
I am proficient in Python, SQL, Tableau, SPSS, and Excel, with intermediate skills in R. Recently, I completed a challenging and innovative project with PureGym, where I applied my skills to deliver actionable insights.

I’m eager to apply my expertise to exciting new data roles and always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working in a team or independently, I’m motivated by discovering new insights and using data to solve complex problems.
